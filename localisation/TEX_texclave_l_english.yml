POLITICS_DUBYA_DESC:0 "After a brutal loss to Donald Rumsfeld in 2002, George W. Bush, Son of the Great George H.W Bush, found himself exiled to the American Consulate in Texas with other high profile anti-Rumsfeld politicians. At that point, George had realised that this was in fact a ploy by Rumsfeld to get rid of several high target opponents, which involved exiling them and basically imprisoning them in an area surrounded by foreign soil. After what one could assume was a bad case of Cabin Fever, George gathered what allies he could and formed a group who, with the upmost secrecy, would dedicate themselves to saving America, this group would later become known as The Enclave. And with their breakout of the consulate, capture of a horse stable and makeshift cavalry charge on the capital, George has finally finished the first phase of his goal. That goal being the reunification of America and the Destruction of all Communists, a goal to which he seeks to accomplish by any means."
