POLITICS_DUBYA_DESC:0 "After a brutal loss to Donald Rumsfeld in 2002, George W. Bush, Son of the Great George H.W Bush, found himself exiled to the American Consulate in Texas with other high profile anti-Rumsfeld politicians. At that point, George had realised that this was in fact a ploy by Rumsfeld to get rid of several high target opponents, which involved exiling them and basically imprisoning them in an area surrounded by foreign soil. After what one could assume was a bad case of Cabin Fever, George gathered what allies he could and formed a group who, with the upmost secrecy, would dedicate themselves to saving America, this group would later become known as The Enclave. And with their breakout of the consulate, capture of a horse stable and makeshift cavalry charge on the capital, George has finally finished the first phase of his goal. That goal being the reunification of America and the Destruction of all Communists, a goal to which he seeks to accomplish by any means."

texas.1.d:0 "As Senators convened to discuss the pressing issue of the latest American election, three bombs detonated throughout the chamber and one in the main hall. As hundreds ran terrified and emergency services scrambled to save what and who they could, it suddenly became clear that there might be no one left. And as of now, authorities are indicating that no sitting Senators survived the blast which has shaken the entire nation to the core. With the dust settling, one question remains... could the pro-Remnant forces we've been hearing from for the past few months be the perpetrators of this grotesque attack?"

texas.5.d:0 "Recently, our great President has seen it upon himself to write a book outlining what every good American should be like, even down to what they should eat, read and do for recreational activities. Though reading is mandatory, there are those who have claimed similarities to communist drivel from the Red Menace and have outright denied it's Patriotic Message. Those who has critiqued our great leader's writings have changed their tune however, after each were given a brief trip to a re-education centre, where they were shown the greatness of America. Other than those dissenters however, the book has had record popularity peaks across the nation, with many taking the doctrines to heart"
