 TUR_Soviet_Puppet:0 "Puppet To Moscow"
 TUR_Soviet_Puppet_desc:0 "Upon the collapse of the American order, our beloved country was left unprotected from the Soviet bear. Kremlin knew how hard would it be to create a Soviet satellite in Turkey because of the people's motives and the fact that an invasion of Turkey would be a disaster for the land forces so they started funding conservatives that would keep the nation asleep and cheerful meanwhile in Ankara, the beloved 'President' bows to NKVD officers and their demands. This has created civil revolt and political organization against the puppet government."
 TUR_Nationals:0 "The National Alliance"
 TUR_Nationals_desc:0 "The National Alliance is a block of like-minded (or they say so) political entities in Turkey that have united-in-arms to oppose the current Edibali order and their national treachery. NA is formed of 3 major groups. \n Doğu Perinçek and his National Bolsheviks \n Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, or more known as Reis and his Anatolian islamists \n Devlet Bahçeli and his greywolves."
 TUR_Millets:0 "The People's Alliance"
 TUR_Millets_desc:0 "The People's Alliance is a block of like-minded (or they say so) political entities in Turkey that have united-in-arms to oppose the current Edibali order, just like the National Alliance. Their diversion point from the Nationals is that they see the nationals as irridentist terror groups, and threats against democracy. This allaince is mostly compromised of Kemalists, with 3 major players \n Deniz Baykal and his status-quo Kemalists \n Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu and his New Kemalists \n Muharrem Ince and his Ulusalcı (National) movement, which is considered 'authoritarian' and 'communist' by the Kemalist circles but Ince claims he is a better Kemalist than the other 'revisionists'."
 TUR_East_Aflame:0 "The East Aflame"
 TUR_East_Aflame_desc:0 "Even though the East can be seen as Turkish territory on the map, the Worker's Party of Kurdestan has absorbed it, continuing their rule of terror. Their leader, Abdullah Öcalan, was breached from the supposedly 'unbreakable' cell 2 years ago, re-sparking the Kurdish terror gangs. We must do something!"
 TUR_Pamukoglu_idea:0 "The Legendary Marshall"
 TUR_Pamukoglu_idea_desc:0 "Osman Pamukoğlu, a very well trained general, has became very renowned in the country with his efforts against Ocalan and his pack of rats. Pamukoğlu is known to host the Free Turkey Organization, a paramilitary organization amongst the army and the youth to break Soviet influence of Turkey. Declaring all other parties dogs and slaves, Pamukoglu has became a legend in Ankara, and a horror story Kurdish mothers tell to their children."
