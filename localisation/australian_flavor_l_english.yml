AST_Faulty_Republic:0 "Faulty Republic"
AST_Faulty_Republic_desc:0 "After the extremely close 1999 Republican Referendum and subsequent Centenary Declaration of 2001, Australia officially became a Federal Republic with John Howard serving as it's first, albiet reluctant, President. The posts of Governor-General and Prime Minister were merged into the position of President, who presides as the Head of State and the Government respectively. However, despite the Republican's best hopes, the system has faltered into a malaise, with the united Republican force behind the Referendum collapsing after a confusing policy of appeasement to all groups within it. Since then, the Republicans have only fractured further, with many people yearning for the days of the Commonwealth."
AST_Lawless_Outback:0 "Lawless Outback"
AST_Lawless_Outback_desc:0 "Ever since our failures to make amends with many Aboriginal tribes, the area colloquially refered to as the bush has become even more of an inhospitable wasteland. Hostile Aboriginal Tribes and Militias, Roaming Bushrangers and Anti-Government groups have eroded our influence in the area, with each administration struggling to control the region."
AST_Communist_Influence:0 "Communist Influence"
AST_Communist_Influence_desc:0 "When the United States fell apart, so did our treaty with them and Britain, for the past few decades, we have become more diplomatically isolated as a result. Because of this, Maoist China and Indonesia have begun exerting their influence in Oceania as a whole."
AST_Political_Maelstrom:0 "Political Maelstrom"
AST_Political_Maelstrom_desc:0 "When Joh Bjelke-Petersen announced his intention for Prime Minister, he caused the Liberal-National Coalition to explode and the vote to be split in 1987, ensuring Labor dominance for years. Since then, the Liberal and National rift has grown larger, with the parties actively against each other. With moderates defecting in droves to the People's Party in the face of President Latham's increasingly right wing rhetoric, the political situation remains tense, to say the least."
AST_Oceanic_Bulwark:0 "Oceanic Bulwark"
AST_Oceanic_Bulwark_desc:0 "After the collapse of our alliances across the world, we had no choice but to form an alliance of our own. Standing tall, the Oceanic Defense Iniative and Australia herself will continue to defend what we have left."
#####BIO SHIT#####
POLITICS_MARK_LATHAM_DESC:0 "Elected in the controversial 2004 election, Mark Latham was enshrined as the 2nd President of the young federal republic. Originally seen as a bit of a boy wonder in the Labor Party, Latham was able to sweep the Labor caucus despite his brash personality and right wing sentiment. Despite the massive turn out however, many projected a Howard landslide, what they got instead was the closest election in decades. All of 42, Latham had become the second youngest leader of Australia and it's second President. Before long however, Latham's control of the party began to wane rapidly, with many unhappy with the new nationalistic and populist direction he was taking the party. This all reached a fever-pitch when many high-profile members of the party defected to the People's Party over an extremely short period, with many of their voters going with them. Sensing chaos in their rivals, the National and Liberal Parties have also capitalised on the political situation, rebuiliding much of their lost influence. Despite it all however, all Australians still look to President Latham to lead them through this new phase of the Island’s destiny."
