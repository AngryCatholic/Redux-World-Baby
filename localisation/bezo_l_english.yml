 natbolamerica.2.d:0 "Every member of the National People's Council has convened in our capital to elect a successor to Supreme Leader Sanders. There is obvious tension circling the room, as various factions stake their claim in the cut throat political game. Despite minor leaders attempting to make themselves heard, there are three major factions that are all on course for victory... albeit some have far greater chances of securing the top job. The loyalist followers of Bernie Sanders from beginning to end are seen as convention favourites, with the experience and political strength necessary to seize power. National Syndicalists have united in a loose coalition to combat loyalists within the Council, and have been voicing strong opinions since before the convention even began. Their unique form of syndicalism will certainly attract the more 'patriotic' corners of American politics. Finally, the Communist faction within our glorious Socialist Party is seen as a dark horse, with immense funding from foreign nations and strong support below."
