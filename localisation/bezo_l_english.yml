 natbolamerica.2.t:0 "Emergency Party Convention"
 natbolamerica.2.d:0 "Every member of the National People's Council has convened in our capital to elect a successor to Supreme Leader Sanders. There is obvious tension circling the room, as various factions stake their claim in the cut throat political game. Despite minor leaders attempting to make themselves heard, there are three major factions that are all on course for victory... albeit some have far greater chances of securing the top job. The loyalist followers of Bernie Sanders from beginning to end are seen as convention favorites, with the experience and political strength necessary to seize power. National Syndicalists have united in a loose coalition to combat loyalists within the Council, and have been voicing strong opinions since before the convention even began. Their unique form of syndicalism will certainly attract the more 'patriotic' corners of American politics. Another dark horse faction is the Bezoists. Although they claim they are communists, many criticize them, saying that they have become too capitalistic to ever call themselves Marxists.  Finally, the Communist faction within our glorious Socialist Party is seen as a dark horse, with immense funding from foreign nations and strong support below."

 natbolamerica.100.d:0 "Jeff Bezos sworn in as Supreme Leader- An early ally of Sanders since the beginning of his revolution, Jeff Besoz has become the newest Supreme Commander . His faction's COMPLETELY unexpected victory in the emergency party convention came as a shock to most, as plans were already in motion to name Sanders protege Jeff Mackler his successor before the chamber closed. This comes as a worrying sign to the socialist leaning members of Sanders administration, as it seems capitalists may once again rule an American republic. His victory came as a surprise to everyone of the Greater American Union, but was much to the delight of all his fellow bureaucrats. Once divided parties now share a common fear and enemy as to what will come in Besoz's rule. Besoz has been hailed as the next great savior of our nation, leaving his office to address hundreds of thousands in the streets below. The age of Sanders will never be forgotten, but it is certainly over forever."
