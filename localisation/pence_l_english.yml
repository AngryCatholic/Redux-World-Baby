POLITICS_PETER_THE_SECOND_DESC:0 "The Traitors in the Vatican have slandered the word of Christ for too long! It is now up to Pence to restore the true word of Christ! Pence, now Pope Peter II has now declared that he and all true believers will form a Kingdom of God on Earth, but only by cleansing the Heresy of Socialism from this world, Ave Pope Peterus II!"
POLITICS_MIKE_PENCE_DESC:0 "Mike Pence and The White Phoenix, many know these names, but not many ever thought these names would ever be tied to the same person. Micheal Richard Pence was born in 1959 to Gas Station Owners in Indiana, A Roman Catholic and a democrat at first, Pence soon became a Conservative after becoming inspired by Ronald Reagan. After graduating law school just before the Collapse, Pence was deeply shocked and scarred by the events of the Collapse and eventually turned to the Catholic Church. Pence became a Priest in the 90s and even had a brief stint as a Catholic radio host before his shut down by the Socialist Government in the late 1996, This event would be one of the reasons for his Religious radicalisation. In 2002, just after more crackdowns began on Religious institutions, Mike Pence disappeared without a trace, soon a radical terrorist by the name of 'The White Phoenix' began their attacks on the Socialist Government. In 2010-2011, The White Phoenix began enacting his plans for a "Religious revolution" in the American People's Commonwealth, but had to flee across the border shortly afterwards. After being chased out of the APC, The White Phoenix was able to cross the border during the chaos and beat back the socialists. During a speech in the bombed out former Capital of the APC, The White Phoenix had revealed himself to be Mike Pence, Pence declared an end to "Godless Socialism" and an advocation for a return to tradition. Now that Mike Pence has cemented his power and begun reversing the Socialist policies enacted in the former APC, Many are wondering how long The White Phoenix can keep that power."
POLITICS_AURELIAN_DESC:0 "Aurelian II is a man of many contradictions, the former President turned Emperor is only thought of as an eccentric madman in the outside world, but the people under his boot know the truth that Aurelian is a despotic genocidal maniac. Born John Sidney McCain III in 1936 at a local hospital in the Panama Canal, McCain later moved back to the US and had a normal childhood. McCain later served in the US Army in Vietnam during Operation Rolling Thunder where he was shot down and captured by the Vietcong, there he experienced torture that would end up leaving him with lifelong physical disabilities. In 1981 McCain retired from the Navy and moved to Arizona, where he entered Politics for the first time, McCain served in the House of Representatives until the collapse of order in the US in 1984, where he was instrumental in saving Arizona's independence and democracy. For the next few decades, McCain had served in Arizona's government until 2000, where McCain tried to run for President but lost the nomination. In 2008 however, McCain ran and won the election in a landslide victory, but before he could even finally get into office, he was shot by a radical communist in the head. McCain barely survived, but during all of this, McCain had some kind of epiphany, though it is unknown what this epiphany even is or what it's about. But during his inauguration speech, John McCain declared himself Emperor Aurelian of the Imperium Romanum and used a group of radical supporters to seize power of the government. With rumours of a brain tumor and the deteriorating sanity of the Emperor, many have began to wonder, "What's his end goal?""
POLITICS_TIMOTHY_MCVEIGH_DESC:0 "Timothy McVeigh is both an American Patriot and a Political Radical. Born in 1968 to Irish Americans in New York, McVeigh's early life was pretty uneventful, the only major thing that happened was when he hacked into the US Government systems using a Commodore 64. A year before the collapse of the US, McVeigh graduated from High School and briefly attended University before dropping out, around this time McVeigh had become extremely interested in firearms and gun rights, even aspiring to become a Gun Store Owner. Around the Collapse McVeigh had enlisted in the Army of the American Republic where he served as a Soldier defending the Federal Government which was fleeing south at the time. After a brief stint in training for the Special Forces, McVeigh began to become extremely disillusioned with the Federal Government and decided to head as far North as he could. After several months of wandering, he made it to Montana where he found himself stuck in a war between Militias of several standings and a mysterious movement under someone called 'Mr K.', McVeigh decided to join the Militia for "Adventure and Freedom". After rising through the ranks of the Militias, McVeigh found himself impressing Militia Leader Ben Garrison, who later made McVeigh his Second-In-Command. McVeigh served as his Second-In-Command where he became disillusioned with Garrison and his dictatorial control of the Militias, he also began to despise the Leader of Montana Harold Covington, even drunkenly proclaiming him as “a hypocritcal dictatorial leech”, this time however McVeigh kept his true loyalties a secret from his superiors, but he began to amass a base of true believers to his cause in secret. With the collapse of the old order in Montana, McVeigh has seized the chance and declared his own state, one free from the shackles of Federal and Dictatorial rule. Many wonder how long this Upstart can keep his Mercenary state afloat however, but to McVeigh it seems the future is bright."
POLITICS_MR_K_DESC:0 "Theodore John Kaczynski is probably one of the most mysterious men in the Modern Era, Not much is actually known about his past except that he was a mathmatical genius and former University Assistant in the 60s. Theodore soon became disillusioned with modern society however and moved to a rural cabin in Montana away from the world, where he tried to live a peaceful life, but soon realised that living off the land was impossible due to Society itself. Theodore then began to mail homade bombs to several University teachers, store owners, even some Government Employees and CEOs too. He was named the 'UNABOMBER' by the FBI after he tried to blow up a United Airlines flight but the bomb failed to explode however. When the US collapsed in 1987, Theodore was ecstatic but the excitement soon ended when Montanan Militias began to replace the fleeing Federal forces. Since then 'Mr K.' has fought a rebellion against the Militias of Montana using several means and has begun to amass several thousand followers to his side, none even really knowing who 'Mr K.' even is. His rebellion might be small, but Mr K. has the upper hand since not even the best Militias can find a trace of him or the convoys that disappear in the night. The local populace has actually turned him into a boogeyman of sorts, which has created more fear around his name and movement, even causing several Militia leaders to refuse entering the areas which have had convoys disappear in, though it is unknown if he even knows that he is feared by the locals. After the collapse of order in Montana, Kaczynski has seized the chance and declared a new state, one where the failures of modern society will not be repeated."

The news media and even the internet has erupted with panic at the sheer scale of what's happening in Ohio as hospitals are being crowded, many across the state are reporting sickness and the Military is rolling out CBRN units to clear the streets of people to prevent further casualties. Throughout all this chaos reaching the streets, only the government has been able to decipher somewhat of the outbreak, and it has left them in even more dread than what was presumed before. Receiving the news from the deployed CBRN units, it was soon realized that it was an anthrax outbreak, and with the seemingly strategic deployment in Urban centers and government offices, it was soon realized this was an attack. But who would do such a thing? Well that now leaves us again with a dreadful likely answer by looking at who is notorious for committing unthinkable attacks against the government in that area.

The entire nation seems to be at a standstill as our politicians worry about their own safety and our people are still falling in the streets, dead on the spot. Only a few have stepped forward to take direct action in this time of crisis, one of those being a representative of the CDC, Doctor Anthony Fauci. Starting the initial efforts to combat the spread, Fauci has been regarded as a hero in the eyes of the nation. This traction seems to snowballing as people are starting to put up murals of Fauci and the frontline doctors, as well as coining phrases, such as when Fauci cynically stated that this was like a new plague and the CDC were the plague doctors, the nation started using the term for those fighting it. Now in the media it appears Fauci isn’t just recommending advice to the people on how to fight the contagion, but also criticizing the government for cowardice, a worrying development considering his popularity."

The proposal was brought forth by Dr Fauci, who’s support base as he continues to combat it only grows larger as people get desperate with supply lines beginning to thin and the idea of not being able to support themselves since they can’t leave home without endangering themselves. Fauci has brought forth a so-called final solution to this disease, and the panic that has resulted from it. His proposal includes allowing the Medical experts of the CDC to take executive control of the government in a cabinet that will oversee the containment, and salvation the people seek as food reaching the homes becomes a worry. While our government ponders over this, the options seem drastic but possibly what we need. Fauci has proved quite a populist, and his views on what to do with the government aren’t exactly known, however at the same time he shows emphasis on it just being temporary until he can set things right.

So far it has yet to be seen if this will work in the long run, however the CDC is reporting that so far things are working optimally across the country. However one thing that was unseen coming was the resistance against his reforms, as well as the confrontations this would bring. Within a few cities there were minor gatherings in front of courthouses and street corners of people stating that the lockdowns were tyrannic in nature, as well as against the taking of loved one’s bodies without consent. While initially these were thought to be quickly dispersed by police or end up having them just go home, some diehard Fauci supporters ended up starting fistfights with these protestors, and while some were just isolated incidents easy to cover up, the response online has not gone unnoticed. Those who even questioned the lockdown orders have been blasted by Fauci supporters into submission, with some cases of harassment and even being banned from platforms as a result.

They allowed terrorists to commit the greatest crime, and yet where was the repercussion to these fiends? There was none because when the Red Death claimed all of our loved ones, they ran to their estates and mansions to hide away, those who claim to care about equality leaving their lesser man to worry about when the next time they could get bread was. However, for everyone of those cowards, I am proud to state there were always 5 more heroes, Frontline doctors, supporters of the lockdown and those who showed no fear in the face of the Red Death. I hereby declare a state of emergency, these cowards who dare say they represent us still will no longer have a say in your livelihoods, as they have shown that while this nation was being molded by the Red Death, they stuck to their old beliefs and cowardice when the rest of the nation showed bravery and strength.

Fauci and his damned thugs were creating a nation that no longer felt safe to Josh, hell even the name ‘National Death State’ sounded as if it came out of some dystopian book. Climbing down and getting into the family truck, his hands started to shake. He was leaving his girlfriend, his parents and his entire life as he knew it behind, all in an attempt to cross the Canadian Border. But freedom was so close, he had to leave, if he got on the highway the police wouldn’t be able to tell that he was a non-essential person, and it was a free stretch to Canada.  It was a long drive from Albany to the border, but he did it, although he had to leave the truck behind on the final stretch as it’s gas ran out. Getting only 3 hours of sleep in this damned cold forest, he was so close to reaching Canada, He could even see the border checkpoint up ahead. He would just run to the left of the checkpoint across and into the protection of the Canadia mounties, yes that would be a safe bet. Just as he began to make the dash he heard a vehicle coming up and in front of him. Just as suddenly men in black coats and with weapons tackled Josh to the ground. He began screaming to the Canadians to save him, before these thugs could do to him the rumors he heard on the web, but he was still on the American side, and thus was condemned to fate. The plague doctors sat in the operating theatre, watching the process. This young man, Josh his name  was before he was ‘offered’ to testing by the Black Gloves. Both doctors watched as his blood was drained out slowly, diffusing outwards in a test to see how the Red Death would interact with no blood cells in a body.

Both doctors had arrived from Cuba, and although both were excited to see the American Metropolis, as of currently it was under less than ideal conditions with the Red Death spreading around. Already the reality of this sobered the foreign doctors up as they flew over the near ghost like city, only to see the sheer crowds outside the medical center. The medical center was heavily guarded, and besides a few lanes for ambulances urgently driving in, most people were being screened and herded outside before slowly being funneled in. Landing on the Helipad, the doctors exited and were greeted by quite a sight, Dr Antony Fauci in plague robes and accompanied by his guards in black shirts. Getting initial formalities out of the way, they entered the facility and went through the whole process of what they were dealing with, easy so far, until Fauci decided to show them the full extent the Red Death could cause to someone. Fauci led them into the rooms of those who ended up getting the most heavily hit by the Red Death, the smell of herbs overpowering the room, yet all that couldn’t cover up the sheer disgust of looking at the fully consumed corpse. Gagging, Amado quickly steeled himself, after all he was a doctor and had to deal with this even if it was an extreme case. The doctors headed out of the room and continued further down the halls, Raul looked like a ghost as his skin still hadn’t gained its color after seeing the body, Amado couldn’t keep his thoughts straight as they went into further secure rooms, with even more herbs covering it so much it became a haze. He didn’t focus on Fauci’s droning, however he did catch something about how all prior medical practices failed, so they had resorted to unorthodox methods. Entering an operating theatre, they were met by an insane sight, as they saw bodies being utilized in experiments by doctors, drained of blood or inserted with new viruses to see them combat each other. ‘This is not medicine, this is plain evil!’ Raul exclaimed, only for Fauci to lay his hands on both their shoulders and explain.  ‘Insanity is doing the same thing expecting different results, I am creating a cure, fixing something the old government never understood and couldn’t conquer. You came here to help and also gather the info to help your country right? Well i'm offering a chance to gather knowledge in ways others would never dare to do, but in their ignorance leave out their chance to be saved from this disease. I’ll give you all the resources you need, if you help me in my goals of conquering this disease.’ Raul looked as if he would resist further but Amado shot a glare at him, Fauci was in control here, plus if he was right about this being the only way to salvation for America, Cuba and potentially the world, He had to at least give it a chance. And so the Cubans joined Fauci in ‘seeking answers to the way the Red Death ticks’."

For your loyalty, bravery and strength, you have been chosen into a new group, one which shall protect this nation from the dangers of the Red Death, and those who will foolishly spread it with their resistance.

Dune examined the body delivered to him by the Black Glove officers, A middle aged man that, although ravaged by the disease, still kept himself healthy. Yes this would be a fine specimen to poke and prod internally as he saw how the Red Death worked, how it interacted with the concoctions Dune would pore inside and see how it battled internally. He would continue until he got bored with it, as always with these specimens, before the body would be taken again to be dumped in a mass grave.

Almost carrying the same culture as Fundamentalists, they also have begun raising strict political structures reminiscent of the Third Reich. The beliefs of the American Clergy have of course also been shaped by this rise, as they were the ones who encouraged it the most.

While all this was going on in the public eye, Peter III made sure to counter any possible backlash this transformation had by creating a much more secretive force.

However those hopes were dashed short when a knock came at the door, strange considering she was not expecting any package and her husband was still at work. Opening the door, she immediately felt a sense of dread at not knowing who these two uniformed men at the door were. She could certainly piece it together with what she heard from rumors about law enforcement cracking down on dissidents with new units, but she didn’t recognize this type of uniform. Perhaps that’s what they intended, as the only sign of actual credible authority was a pendant around their necks with the symbol of the eagle. She began denying their requests to come in and tried to dodge some of the harder questions about why she wouldn’t let them in, and as she was about to close the door, one of the men stuck his boot in the doorway and invited himself in. Taking a seat at the dining table as she was ordered by the men, they quickly asked her if anyone else was in the house. Her son was upstairs, and she quickly called him down as the men wanted him to be present. Sitting down, one of the men asked her son if anybody else lived in the house, when he didn't get the answer he wanted he asked again if mom had any friends over recently. Quickly Samantha realized he was asking about her best friend, Charlotte. She was a mormon who became paranoid of persecution when Pence came to power, and then when Peter III came she fully went missing. She quickly began trying to intervene when the man silenced her and gave her a smile. ``Ma'am, it would be much quicker if you just gave us Charlotte, since you should know hiding a mormon is heretical in the highest order.’’ Once she kept denying any idea that she knew where her best friend was, the mood of the two men in the room sharply deteriorated, and the sitting one pulled out a cigarette and calmly stated they would tear the house down before being denied their prize. That was all an hour ago, Now Samantha sits on the steps to the house with her son, sobbing as the house was practically ransacked as they searched for any signs of extra living space or hidden areas, with the men leaving once they did not find who they were looking for.

Every Holy Roman Empire needs it’s unifier, it’s Charlemagne to establish its noble identity, and so today I shall crown our Charlemagne.’  Ending his speech, Peter III asked for the recipient to step forward for crowning, and to much of the audience’s surprise, for the man about to be crowned was Christopher Lee. Being notorious within the circles of the clergy, Lee had involved himself with the organization, being a proud supporter and even engaging in subversive activities to help bring about Pence’s seizure of power. Now it appears that this is the man Peter III has chosen to become the new emperor as he takes the knee in front of the pope and allows himself to have the crown placed upon his temples by Peter.

Once their intentions to show that this is what they considered to be the new model for the West as a whole, they began marches of the Clergy’s paramilitary forces and other catholic organizations such as youth league’s, all carrying banners of the state, while portraits of Pence and Peter III were carried reverently by the crowd, where they placed it at the feet of the podium where the leadership stood and placed them down, alongside roses and other such gifted items. Then once the marches of the supporter’s died down, they decided to take a much more marshall tone as the military began their march. Fighter jets flew over the rally grounds in formations, their soundwash being loud, but never loud enough to deafen the crowd. Followed by that was Emperor Lee himself, riding on horseback alongside a mounted honor guard as they led the vehicles of the Empire’s military behind him.

The crowd’s had seemed to disregard his former assistance in raising them to power, as they held at first congregations to denounce him as their representing cardinal, however these quickly turned into religious riots once he refused to give up the position. It seemed the pressure soon was too much for him to handle, as he did resign once the violent nature of the riots threatened to tarnish the clergy’s image in New York.
