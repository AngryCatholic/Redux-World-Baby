 usa.182.d:0 "Within the past few years, the American monarchy has radically changed, morphing from hereditary despotism under Mark Milley and Paul I to a true democratic system under an elected monarch of House Hamilton, architects of a new America. Following this reformation of our monarchy into an elective, federalist system, Douglas I Hamilton has called for new snap elections, with [Root.GetLeader] expected to run again.\n\nChallenging our current PM, however, lies a candidate many expect would despise everything Hamilton stood for, small government libertarian Tucker Carlson, and representing the Independence Union's Hamiltonian wing, fiscal and social moderate Jim Justice. An economic liberal seeking to restore small government values, Carlson would like to see both the King and Congress leave social and economic freedoms to the people, while Jim Justice, emblematic of a populist and moderate conservative appeal, echoes the hard-working, immigrant values of House Hamilton.\n\nThe People's Party and National Renewal Party, of course, have continued to remain involved in politics, but neither of their candidates have appeared uniquely Hamiltonian in an era of monarchy."

usa.300.d:0 "With reports coming in from officials last night, it has been confirmed that a revolution took place within the nation's capital. Many citizens of the republic woke up this morning to the news that Cupp and his Rural Peoples Party lead a revolt against the government, and now has proclaimed himself the new Supreme Leader. This, however, comes as no real shock to the American people, as after the death of the Chief, a huge power vacuum was left behind, and it was assumed that one of the factions under the umbrella of the National Renewal Party would seize power. Cupp now hopes to implement a policy of Juche - or 'self-sufficiency' - but also wants to bring his own nationalist twist into the system. Will this crazed individual fill the power vacuum left behind after the death of Duke, or will his regime fall into disaster and be remembered as one of histories twisted footnotes? Only time will tell..."

However it could be argued that in reality no one came out victorious as they are still facing the consequences of this brutal war and are in dire need of our support.

usa.320:t:0 "Dixieland Delight" 
usa.320.d:0 "Today in Atlanta, in an announcement in the capitol building, key figures of the League of the South got together in a press conference following the nation’s concerns as to what the state of affairs will look like. While reporters were being screened into the events outside the building celebrating their victory and the press conference at the end, it was hard not to notice the amount of confederate battle banners and the emblems of the League flying openly throughout. Finally, after having everyone gather for the announcement, Michael Hill, one of the activists who created and propelled the League of the South, walked to the speaking podium and began his announcement. Assuring the people of the nation that the American spirit would not be lost in any tyrannical display’s, he actually promised that the League would ensure freedom beyond what the Republican party had shown to the nation in the past decade. After these promises of keeping a proud and free nation, as well as defending the people from the dangers of the socialist Yankee’s from the commonwealth, he passed the microphone to former senator Robert C Byrd, who appeared to be wearing a confederate officer’s uniform. Nicknamed ‘Stonewall Byrd’ for his actions in giving the socialists a bloody nose as they invaded his state of West Virginia, he became an endorser of the League of the South following his exile down here. Seemingly being granted leadership of the nation, Byrd thanked Hill for his duty to the ‘preserving American culture’, before pulling forth a cavalry sabre used in the first civil war and swearing an oath to protect the freedoms,livelihoods and culture of the people from those socialists seeking to destroy southron as it represented the last bastion of what America once was."

usa.321.t:0 "Honoring Stonewall Byrd" 
usa.321.d:0 "The collapse, the second civil war, all these terms attempt to caption the chaos of the event, yet none truly will get the feeling of it all, as it was both these terms and so much more. Mass movement of people as cities became swept up in fiery uprisings, the chaos as political order seemingly collapsed. Some areas of the nation attempted to negotiate peace and prevent conflict within their borders as the politics changed, while others went down in last stands such as the marines in San Diego. All around the country each state, county and city went through its own chaotic transition and skirmishes, and West Virginia was thought to be the same as everywhere else, had it not been for the actions of a man who would gain the long lost nickname of ‘Stonewall’ for his actions, Senator Robert C Byrd. Being a Senator from West Virginia, Byrd made himself known for his segregationist views, as well as being a part of the Senate for so long that he was regarded as being only underneath the speaker of the house. Retiring shortly before the collapse, Byrd was expecting to peacefully live out the rest of his life, that was until the chaos swept into West Virginia and the federal government nearly instantly collapsed, while the national guard were routed from the north of the state due to the sheer amount of miners and socialist volunteers spilling over from pennsylvania to fight the federals. Stepping out of retirement, he rallied the state’s guard and gathered volunteers against what he saw as socialist outside, who he was sure to give a bloody nose. And bleed they most definitely did, the Ambush at summersville saw a mile long convoy of busses and trucks carrying socialist soldiers around the flank of the federals reduced to wrecks, while at the Mink shoals the federals humiliated the superior Socialist force. However, for all these wins, the socialists kept grinding on, and eventually Charleston would fall, and Byrd’s force would be reduced to holding an insurgency in the mountains to keep a trail for refugees fleeing to the federal bastion in the south. Eventually retreating, Byrd yet again settled down as the tragedy of losing West Virginia was hitting him hard, which also prompted him into endorsing the League of the South. Now he has been elevated to the Nation’s leadership, and it will be seen how he changes the nation into the vision he sees after the experiences he underwent."

usa.322.t:0 "Reviving the Plantation Systems" 
usa.322.d:0 "Frequently in the past week, members of the League of the South have been meeting in the Capitol building’s meeting rooms to discuss and draft plans for the revitalization of the economy in a southern fashion. It is no secret the economy has been in shambles after the collapse, with protests being a regular occurrence both before and now during the League’s control of the nation. Wishing to keep their promises to the people about restoring America’s economic greatness, League leader Michael Hill and cabinet member Steven Wilkins have met to discuss the bringing back of Southern style plantation systems, involving sharecropping and other style systems that will provide the jolt needed for the market to get back on track. Already speech writers are preparing another fiery script for Byrd to address the nation as it further turns to the old ways of the confederacy to fix their current struggles. Despite these seemingly old fashioned tactics, many still praise these attempts by the government at fixing the economic situation. Especially among farmers is the praise most wide, with even a minor exodus from the city of those former farmers or unemployed moving back into the country, the drive of possible profit and even a sense of purpose bringing them back to old family farms to attend the fields once more. So far in the eyes of the public all looks well, however some determined journalists went into the more rural parts of the country to see how the state is incentivizing these changes, and found something that brought up bad memories of the past. State penitentiaries and other prisons are releasing prisoners onto fields to do labor that most of the time will only result in the system’s profit, with the prisoners being assigned the labor only getting scraps of money."

usa.323.d:0 "The bell of the Church of our Savior in Atlanta, Georgia rang out as more and more people gathered inside, a sight that has been much more common across the nation, both in numbers and the style of faith. Supporting the so-called ‘high churches’ across the nation, they have endorsed these large organizations and helped them spread their influence across the states, becoming much more common as the state believes them to be faithful to Southron culture. With this new rapid increase in a different sect and money being sent to them, old churches are now being recreated to fit much larger gatherings and be much more grandeur to the outside eye. Byrd himself has held multiple public meetings in opening ceremonies of these churches or during sermons. These High Churches, mixed in with southron culture have formed a sort of mixed christian faith, for while it is officially a part of protestant faith, it resembles early catholicism, with some beliefs of other sect’s sprinkled in."

usa.324.t:0 "Death to Yankeedom" 
usa.324.d:0 "Today in a Fiery speech, Byrd has stated that the reason America collapsed was due to the slow degradation of the individual’s spirit thanks to the efforts of the northern yankee’s. Personally bringing the remaining flag of the American Republic down from its pole, Byrd attached and brought the mast of the confederacy up. Later that day on the internet and all over political offices, members of the League of the South posted manifesto’s and mailed pamphlets stating that ‘Yankeedom’ had been a destroying force, all the way from the 1800’s where they threw away the founding fathers vision and destroyed the original confederacy to today, where the former stars of America are a distant memory as the northerners have fallen to socialist ideals, not fitting of the godly south. Counties in the north have reported protests right after Byrd’s statement went viral, with many flying the former stars and stripes freely. However it seems that this only egged the proud members of the LOTS on as quickly fights and larger brawl’s began erupting between Yankees and Southerners, eventually with the League’s paramilitary of the Grey Shirts coming in to disperse the yank protests. It seems that the gradual process towards full on southern embrace has gotten closer to its end goal of embracing the confederacy of old, and bringing it back to reject modern day ideal’s."

Finally, right at the tick of the nearby tower’s clock, a loud SHWOOM was heard, with the sky lighting up an initial red, before finally blue and the occasional white star came along to make it a bunch of proud colors in the sky. This carried on, national colors, golden stars and whistlers kept flying, until the end where a final row on the barge all shot at once, forming the flag of the south with it’s calculated detonation. John could close his eyes and still see the formed banner in his retina. Suddenly he felt Anna shift into him, and realized at that moment that he loved Southron, and everything blessed about it."
