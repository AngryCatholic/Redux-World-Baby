usa.313.d:0 "The hot Georgian sun beamed down on the crowd - a shifting and energized mass of red-blooded American patriots all vibrating in anticipation as they awaited the arrival of their Father, their Chief. After waiting an unending eternity dragged on by their excited state and the ample amount of good libations enjoyed during the rally, the crowd turned from a raucous cacophony to a congregation so quiet you could hear a pin drop as Chief Duke took the stage. \n\nStriding in front of his awe-struck audience, Duke glided over to the podium as if floated along by the Angel’s himself before firmly planting himself at the lectern, finally beginning his speech. With sun rays breaking through white clouds to illuminate the Chief as if God himself was spotlighting this true American hero, the Chief dived into his prepared mantra as the crowd listened with an unbroken, almost trance-like state. \n\nAs his raucous and booming voice carried through the field, Duke slowly whipped his congregation into a frenzy with his great words of wisdom and over his promises of rebirth and renewal of the American Way. However, with the crowd in such a patriotic fury, the sneaking snakes within the audience had found the cover they needed to go through with their dark task. \n\nCutting through the boisterous noise like a heated blade, a shot rang out in the air, silencing the crowd’s cheers and chants save for the screams of the innocent. Though one of the gunmen was instantly tackled to the ground to be mauled apart by the frenzied crowd, his accomplices took to the wind and ran as the Chief - the National Father of our New America - collapsed to the floor. As his attendants and guards ran to his aid, morestill took chase to the fleeing assassins while the rest of Duke’s entourage moved to aid the bleeding Chief. As the paramedics scour his body looking for the wound, the nation sits on the edge of its seat, hoping and praying that their Chief pulls through, for without this uniting figure holding the nation and the National Renewal Party together, the future of our new America is as dark and uncertain as ever."

usa.314.d:0 "With the tragic assassiniation of our beloved Chief David Duke at the hands of vile Socialist abhumans and their wicked allies, our new America has been thrown into complete chaos as the political allies and underlings of the late Chief now jockey for control over the National Renewal Party and the nation as a whole. With his death, the only thing keeping the NRP from falling apart into factionalism and competition has died too, and now the nation sits on the brink of a new era, all depending on who of Duke’s possible successors take charge. \n\nTo combat this chaos and to prevent further bloodshed and infighting, the NRP has called for immediate internal elections to finally decide who shall take the Chief’s place as the leader of the Free and Pure White Western World. Perhaps the biggest name in NRP following the Chief’s demise is none other than Mel Columcille Gerard Gibson, a once famous actor turned political dynamo whose Chrisitan Front has exploded in popularity in recent years. The CF is primarily composed of a wide-array of Conservative Chrisitans, and this pious party stands as the relative ‘moderates’ within the NRP, only advocating for the removal of State and Church separations, the end of Secularism as an idea in American, and for truly pious Chrisitan government to have complete control over America’s political and social futures. Though these altar boys led by Gibson are likely the favorites to win given their size and large reach, the CF is far from the only faction vying for dominance. Opposing the CF stands the Rural People's Party, a coalition of National Socialists, National Bolsheviks, and other various ethnic-nationalist populist movements who swear by a system they call ‘White Juche.’ Taking influence from Adolf Hitler, Pol Pot, Jim Jones, and many other champions of ‘Nationalist Socialism,’ this coalition led by John Paul Cupp are practically foaming at the mouth for their chance to take the late Chief's place as leader of this new America. \n\nStanding opposed to these ideas are the Southern Democratic Senators aligned with NR, led by Senator turned anti-Socialist militia leader Robert C. Byrd. These holdouts of the old America wish to create a new, Southern-based United States, bringing the nation back to its heyday of the 1830’s when men were chattels and cotton was king. The final faction within this competition for power is Pastor Anderson and his Fundamentalists - evangelical baptists who have taken a lot of fire recently from other, outside groups, being likened to groups like ISIS or the Taliban, but entirely Christian and American. Seeking to return America to its puritanical past, Anderson and his group want to bring the teachings and warnings of the Holy Scriptures to life, with public stonings, lashings, witch trials, and other puritianical laws all making their return to American soil. \n\nWith the stage set and the four main factions now battling for supremacy within the chambers of the NRP, it is now only a matter of time before our new, White America is graced with its new Chief."

This, however, comes as no real shock to the American people, as after the death of the Chief, a huge power vacuum was left behind, and it was assumed that one of the factions under the umbrella of the National Renewal Party would seize power. Cupp now hopes to implement a policy of Juche - or 'self-sufficiency' - but also wants to bring his own nationalist twist into the system.

usa.320.d:0 "Today in Atlanta, in an announcement in the capitol building, key figures of the League of the South got together in a press conference following the nation’s concerns as to what the state of affairs will look like. While reporters were being screened into the events outside the building celebrating their victory and the press conference at the end, it was hard not to notice the amount of confederate battle banners and the emblems of the League flying openly throughout. Finally, after having everyone gather for the announcement, Michael Hill, one of the activists who created and propelled the League of the South, walked to the speaking podium and began his announcement. Assuring the people of the nation that the American spirit would not be lost in any tyrannical display’s, he actually promised that the League would ensure freedom beyond what the Republican party had shown to the nation in the past decade. After these promises of keeping a proud and free nation, as well as defending the people from the dangers of the socialist Yankee’s from the commonwealth, he passed the microphone to former senator Robert C Byrd, who appeared to be wearing a confederate officer’s uniform. Nicknamed ‘Stonewall Byrd’ for his actions in giving the socialists a bloody nose as they invaded his state of West Virginia, he became an endorser of the League of the South following his exile down here. Seemingly being granted leadership of the nation, Byrd thanked Hill for his duty to the ‘preserving American culture’, before pulling forth a cavalry sabre used in the first civil war and swearing an oath to protect the freedoms,livelihoods and culture of the people from those socialists seeking to destroy southron as it represented the last bastion of what America once was."

usa.321.t:0 "Honoring Stonewall Byrd" 
usa.321.d:0 "The collapse, the second civil war, all these terms attempt to caption the chaos of the event, yet none truly will get the feeling of it all, as it was both these terms and so much more. Mass movement of people as cities became swept up in fiery uprisings, the chaos as political order seemingly collapsed. Some areas of the nation attempted to negotiate peace and prevent conflict within their borders as the politics changed, while others went down in last stands such as the marines in San Diego. All around the country each state, county and city went through its own chaotic transition and skirmishes, and West Virginia was thought to be the same as everywhere else, had it not been for the actions of a man who would gain the long lost nickname of ‘Stonewall’ for his actions, Senator Robert C Byrd. Being a Senator from West Virginia, Byrd made himself known for his segregationist views, as well as being a part of the Senate for so long that he was regarded as being only underneath the speaker of the house. Retiring shortly before the collapse, Byrd was expecting to peacefully live out the rest of his life, that was until the chaos swept into West Virginia and the federal government nearly instantly collapsed, while the national guard were routed from the north of the state due to the sheer amount of miners and socialist volunteers spilling over from pennsylvania to fight the federals. Stepping out of retirement, he rallied the state’s guard and gathered volunteers against what he saw as socialist outside, who he was sure to give a bloody nose. And bleed they most definitely did, the Ambush at summersville saw a mile long convoy of busses and trucks carrying socialist soldiers around the flank of the federals reduced to wrecks, while at the Mink shoals the federals humiliated the superior Socialist force. However, for all these wins, the socialists kept grinding on, and eventually Charleston would fall, and Byrd’s force would be reduced to holding an insurgency in the mountains to keep a trail for refugees fleeing to the federal bastion in the south. Eventually retreating, Byrd yet again settled down as the tragedy of losing West Virginia was hitting him hard, which also prompted him into endorsing the League of the South. Now he has been elevated to the Nation’s leadership, and it will be seen how he changes the nation into the vision he sees after the experiences he underwent."

usa.322.t:0 "Reviving the Plantation Systems" 
usa.322.d:0 "Frequently in the past week, members of the League of the South have been meeting in the Capitol building’s meeting rooms to discuss and draft plans for the revitalization of the economy in a southern fashion. It is no secret the economy has been in shambles after the collapse, with protests being a regular occurrence both before and now during the League’s control of the nation. Wishing to keep their promises to the people about restoring America’s economic greatness, League leader Michael Hill and cabinet member Steven Wilkins have met to discuss the bringing back of Southern style plantation systems, involving sharecropping and other style systems that will provide the jolt needed for the market to get back on track. Already speech writers are preparing another fiery script for Byrd to address the nation as it further turns to the old ways of the confederacy to fix their current struggles. Despite these seemingly old fashioned tactics, many still praise these attempts by the government at fixing the economic situation. Especially among farmers is the praise most wide, with even a minor exodus from the city of those former farmers or unemployed moving back into the country, the drive of possible profit and even a sense of purpose bringing them back to old family farms to attend the fields once more. So far in the eyes of the public all looks well, however some determined journalists went into the more rural parts of the country to see how the state is incentivizing these changes, and found something that brought up bad memories of the past. State penitentiaries and other prisons are releasing prisoners onto fields to do labor that most of the time will only result in the system’s profit, with the prisoners being assigned the labor only getting scraps of money."

usa.323.t:0 "Southron way of Faith" 
usa.323.d:0 "The bell of the Church of our Savior in Atlanta, Georgia rang out as more and more people gathered inside, a sight that has been much more common across the nation, both in numbers and the style of faith. Supporting the so-called ‘high churches’ across the nation, they have endorsed these large organizations and helped them spread their influence across the states, becoming much more common as the state believes them to be faithful to Southron culture. With this new rapid increase in a different sect and money being sent to them, old churches are now being recreated to fit much larger gatherings and be much more grandeur to the outside eye. Byrd himself has held multiple public meetings in opening ceremonies of these churches or during sermons. These High Churches, mixed in with southron culture have formed a sort of mixed christian faith, for while it is officially a part of protestant faith, it resembles early catholicism, with some beliefs of other sect’s sprinkled in."

usa.324.d:0 "Today in a Fiery speech, Byrd has stated that the reason America collapsed was due to the slow degradation of the individual’s spirit thanks to the efforts of the northern yankee’s. Personally bringing the remaining flag of the American Republic down from its pole, Byrd attached and brought the mast of the confederacy up. Later that day on the internet and all over political offices, members of the League of the South posted manifesto’s and mailed pamphlets stating that ‘Yankeedom’ had been a destroying force, all the way from the 1800’s where they threw away the founding fathers vision and destroyed the original confederacy to today, where the former stars of America are a distant memory as the northerners have fallen to socialist ideals, not fitting of the godly south. Counties in the north have reported protests right after Byrd’s statement went viral, with many flying the former stars and stripes freely. However it seems that this only egged the proud members of the LOTS on as quickly fights and larger brawl’s began erupting between Yankees and Southerners, eventually with the League’s paramilitary of the Grey Shirts coming in to disperse the yank protests. It seems that the gradual process towards full on southern embrace has gotten closer to its end goal of embracing the confederacy of old, and bringing it back to reject modern day ideal’s."

It was about to begin, the sky was already dark and on the river he could see outlines of the barge that would shoot the fireworks. It was the 4th of July, both John and Anna had made sure to set their schedules clear today to meet at the public park overlooking the river, A statue of Bobby Lee watching over the grass as they sat down, beginning to bring out their homemade snacks out of a basket. Finally, right at the tick of the nearby tower’s clock, a loud SHWOOM was heard, with the sky lighting up an initial red, before finally blue and the occasional white star came along to make it a bunch of proud colors in the sky. This carried on, national colors, golden stars and whistlers kept flying, until the end where a final row on the barge all shot at once, forming the flag of the south with it’s calculated detonation. John could close his eyes and still see the formed banner in his retina. Suddenly he felt Anna shift into him, and realized at that moment that he loved Southron, and everything blessed about it."
